		The owner of this site wants to indicate that there is no copyright protected content stored on
		the servers of letswatch.cz.
	</p>
	<p>
		All offered files are stored on external file hosts that are in no way associated with
		letswatch.cz.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are a rights holder of a file listed here, do not contact us, but the providers on whose
		servers any copyrighted material is stored. letswatch.cz offers, acting like a search engine,
		only links to files and not the files themself, this is the reason why the owners of this
		website are not responsible and according to Teleservices Act also can not be held liable.
	</p>
	<p>
		The operator is not liable for copyright infringement due to the fact that no video is on its
		own server and has no way of verifying the copyright compliance of other operators who make
		these works available.
	</p>
	<p>
		We dissociate ourselves from the contents and have no influence on it. letswatch.cz is merely a
		facilitator of external content, for legally protected content the providers hosting this
		content (filehosters) are responsible.
	</p>
	<p>
		The letswatch.cz website just links to the videos, the called embedding has been declared legal
		by an EU court and therefore we're not breaking any laws.
